## structure for paper presentations

<details><summary>prep time</summary>
It is recommended that all of us go through the papers before the meeting. The presenter should read the paper in complete detail, whereas others can read it with varying degrees of depth depending on their time commitment and what they want to get out of the paper.
At least the idea and the basic ingredients of the paper should be understood by all â€” This is to ensure we all delve straight into the problem.
</details>

<details><summary>startup time</summary>
The first 15 minutes of the meeting will be dedicated for reading the paper (no discussion). This is for people who haven't got the time or want to review the paper if they read it before. People who are already familiar with the paper can join later (or mute and do something else).
</details>

<details><summary>guided discussion</summary>
The presenter of the day focuses on
* Key aspects of the paper and the solution novelty
* Critiques, shortcomings, limitations if any
* Clarification of questions and discussion
* How it might help or guide our research.
</details>

<details><summary>documentation</summary>
It is encouraged to prepare a slide deck for the presentation and a summary document, post-hoc including feedback and ideas from the discussion phase. Links to these can be shared via the mailing list or in the schedule on the website.
