# [Elixir Reading Group Website](https://elixir-reading-group.github.io/)


## Editing:
The main content lives in `_pages/`:
* `about.md`
* `schedule.md`

To add a news item, create a new announcement file in the `_news/` directory.

Just commit and push your changes, the website will be rebuild automatically.
As a non-member, you can submit a pull-request. If this is new to you, here is a [link to a brief guide](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962).
