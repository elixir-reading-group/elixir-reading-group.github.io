Our focus in this work is on the German language. For this purpose, we propose to first generate a dataset from the German Wikipedia and then use it to pre-train a model that can be fine-tuned with a small dataset and used directly in information retrieval systems. Our model is built on top of gBERT(the German version in this work) which means that during training we initialize our model with gBERT's parameters, which saves a lot of time because BERT already has the ability to extract features from text and during our training the model just uses these features to find similarities between different documents. Our method is considered as unsupervised learning because the dataset we use is generated in an unsupervised manner. Our work is based on the assumption that training an information retrieval model on a large amount of unsupervised data before adapting it to a small amount of well-structured data could improve the performance of the model. The results of our work show evidences in favor of this assumption, as we observe that our model did improve slightly over the model that did not have this pre-training step. It would therefore be advantageous to use our approach in non-English retriever for language with lack of training data. </details> <p>Presenter: Alex Walker Mboutchouang Ghomsi</p> <p>2) A Visualized Counterfactual-Annotation Tool for Language Models Assessment</p> <details><summary>Abstract</summary> In a world, where language models are becoming increasingly complex, people developed tools to help users assess the risk the models might suffer from under-deployment. SparCAssist is one of the risk-assessment tools leveraging counterfactual explanations to expose models' risky behavior in counterfactual instances. For the SparCAssist, however, there still remains improvement potential to help people generate counterfactual instances that are human-understandable more efficiently. In this work, I propose a visualization enhancement of the SparCAssist to help people generate better counterfactual instances and a better understanding of the model's behavior. The thesis starts with a brief tour of foundational knowledge required by introducing the SparcAssist including ExPred, an interpretable-by-design language-classification model used in SparCAssist, approaches to generate counterfactual instances like Hotflip and Masked-Language-Model. Then, I will go into the implementation of my enhancement by specifically introducing the visual presentation. Finally, I evaluate my approach by conducting a set of user experiments proving that my visualization enhancement improves the efficacy of generating counterfactual instances of interest and helps users to better understand the decisions of the models. </details> <p>Presenter: Liam Stewart Boyle</p> <h4 id="03-november-2022">03.

Recently, thanks to new XAI evaluation metrics, it has become possible to compare these XAI solutions. However, selecting the most relevant XAI solution among all this diversity is still a tedious task, especially if a user has specific needs and constraints. In this paper, we propose AutoXAI, a framework that recommends the best XAI solution and its hyperparameters according to specified XAI evaluation metrics while considering the user's context (dataset, machine learning model, XAI needs and constraints). It adapts approaches from context-aware recommender systems on one side and strategies of optimization and evaluation from AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) on the other. Through two use cases, we show that AutoXAI recommends XAI solutions adapted to the user's needs with the best hyperparameters matching the user's constraints. </details> <p>Presenter: Robin Cugny</p> <h4 id="20-october-2022">20.

Explaining the effect of training data on neural network predictions is an essential tool for model debugging. Several instance attribution methods for finding influential training examples, including influence functions, GradDot, GradCos, representer point selection, and TracIn, estimate the most influential training instances for a test prediction. This thesis evaluates the current state of instance attribution and its methods in deep learning, specifically for image classification models. We developed an instance-attribution toolkit that implements these instance attribution methods with a unified API. In a series of experiments, we show that instance attribution methods are highly capable of retrieving the most helpful and most harmful training instance given a test query. In addition, we test these methods on downstream tasks, such as identifying mislabelled or poisoned training data instances, and answer the question of which method should be used in which scenario. We also explore the challenge of evaluating instance attribution methods and validate these algorithms with minimal requirement tests. </details> <p>Presenter: Felix Meyer</p> <h4 id="15-september-2022">15.

Whether we're searching the web, shopping for products online, or trying to find our favorite movies on a streaming platform: An information retrieval system will be responsible for tackling these tasks. As a consequence of recent advances in natural language processing, employing large pre-trained language models as part of a text retrieval pipeline has become a common approach. However, despite their proven effectiveness, these neural network based models are functional black boxes, meaning it is not clear to us as to how they arrive at certain decisions. To get a better understanding of the inner workings of such a model, we apply the recently emerging probing paradigm. By employing a diagnostic classifier, this approach enables us to analyze how certain properties are encoded within a model's hidden representations. Unlike previous research that has focused on general linguistic properties, we explicitly study the layer-wise distribution of ranking related knowledge throughout the popular BERT model, a large neural network that has been trained on massive amounts of text data. In this thesis, we provide evidence that BERT not only stores ranking related concepts, but also orders them in a hierarchical manner. Moreover, we leverage our findings to design a multi-task learning setup which infuses task specific information at different layers of BERT, in order to improve the model's ability to rank. </details> <p>Presenter: Fabian Beringer</p> <h4 id="04-august-2022">04.

However, these highly over-parameterized models tend to be data-hungry and require large amounts of data even for fine tuning.This paper proposes a simple yet effective method to improve ranking performance on smaller datasets using supervised contrastive learning for the document ranking problem. We perform data augmentation by creating training data using parts of the relevant documents in the query-document pairs. We then use a supervised contrastive learning objective to learn an effective ranking model from the augmented dataset. Our experiments on subsets of the TREC-DL dataset show that, although data augmentation leads to an increasing the training data sizes, it does not necessarily improve the performance using existing pointwise or pairwise training objectives. However, our proposed supervised contrastive loss objective leads to performance improvements over the standard non-augmented setting showcasing the utility of data augmentation using contrastive losses. Finally, we show the real benefit of using supervised contrastive learning objectives by showing marked improvements in smaller ranking datasets relating to news (Robust04), finance (FiQA), and scientific fact checking (SciFact). </details> <p>Presenter: Abhijit Anand</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2022 Elixir Reading Group. <a href="https://github.com/elixir-reading-group/elixir-reading-group.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edit on GitHub.</a> Last updated: November 25, 2022. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.11.2/dist/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha256-l/1pMF/+J4TThfgARS6KwWrk/egwuVvhRzfLAMQ6Ds4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.1/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha256-SyTu6CwrfOhaznYZPoolVw2rxoY7lKYKQvqbtqN93HI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@4/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.0.6/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-EdPgYcPk/IIrw7FYeuJQexva49pVRZNmt3LculEr7zM=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/zoom.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/common.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script> <script defer src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script> </body> </html>
